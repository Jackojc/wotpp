# wot++
Wot++ is a macro language which allows you to abstract away the boilerplate when writing things like HTML by hand or even
more low level tasks which require bit-level manipulation.

### What does Wot++ do differently to things like LaTeX and Groff?
In contrast to LaTeX and Groff, Wot++ is a macro-first, text-second language. What do I mean by this?
In LaTeX or Groff, the text is the primary focus with macros being an "opt-in" thing you can use inbetween the words.
It's the exact opposite in Wot++, you have to "opt-in" to using text by quoting it.

Wot++ is far more flexible through its ability to use meta-programming, recursion, conditionals, external shell programs etc.

### Prerequisites
- A C++17 compliant compiler. (GCC & Clang work)

### Build & Run

#### With make:
`make`
`./build/wpp <file>`

#### With meson:
```
$ meson builddir
$ ninja -C builddir
$ ninja -C builddir test # to run the tests
```

You can pass extra options to the meson command, or by running `meson configure -Doption1=value -Doption2=value ...` in the build directory.
For example, to enable stripping debug symbols on install, and set the build type to release, pass `-Dbuildtype=release -Dstrip=true`.

List of built-in options can be found [here](https://mesonbuild.com/Builtin-options.html).
