[ Self redefinition of functions. ]

		let foo =
			"b"

			let foo =
				"c"

	foo foo foo

	[ This outputs "abc". Each invokation of `foo` causes it to be redefined. ]


[ Calling functions that aren't yet defined. ]
	let callback =
		cb_handle "foo"

	[ Somewhere far away in user code. ]
	let cb_handle x =
		x "bar"

	callback  [ `callback` now calls our user-defined `cb_handle`. ]
