Wot++ started as a joke a few years ago that has evolved into a bit of a running gag in a few communities I'm
a part of. Wot++ has gone through many changes and forms over the years.

Originally, Wot++ started out as an esoteric language mirroring brainfuck which would have been one of my
first forays into language development.

Version 1:

Version 2:

Version 3:

Version 4:


seeing as noone is really asking for _another_ general purpose language. I set my sights on something a little
more specialised and obscure in the hopes of it becoming a good tool for niche purposes.

At the time, I was using tools like LaTeX, Groff and Markdown for college notes but found each of them to be lacking
in some regard. None of them really offered the level of programmability and control I wanted from a text processing
language. I wanted to change that in Wot++ by making heavy use of macros and meta-programming which let you build up
layers of abstraction and create re-usable templates.
